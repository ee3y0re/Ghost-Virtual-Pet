# Ghost-Virtual-Pet (WIP)

## Do you believe in ghosts?
Hopefully, you won't be in disbelief or fear over this one! This game allows you to feed, clean, pet (sorta), and shelter a sassy little ghost. The catch is, can you be a loving parent even with its cheeky language and transmissible nature? Neglect comes with consequences, so it’s important to remain alert to this ghost’s needs. Raise its stats high enough by carefully clicking commands to interact with it to help it grow to its fullest potential.


## Functionality and MVPs
- Use mouse clicks on the fruit icon fruit icon for feeding.
- Click on the ghosts droppings after clicking the trash icon for cleaning.
- Even this ghost loves cuddles, so click directly to pet.
- Experience different weather states and have the option to respond and shelter the pet.
- Modify the settings of the game through the icons on the left of the screen
  - Resetting the game or muting and unmuting the sound
  - See more information about the game through the About modal
  - Unlock achievements with status reach and grow the ghost to its fullest potential.
